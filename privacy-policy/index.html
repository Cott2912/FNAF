                <p>This Privacy Policy</p>
                <p>This privacy policy describes FNAF’s current policies and practices with regard to personal
                    data collected by FNAF through its web sites, FNAF.com . This privacy policy is
                    independent from FNAF’s offline personal data collection practices. The term “personal
                    data” refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, birth date,
                    e-mail address or mailing address, and any other information that is identified with you
                    personally.</p>
                <p>Notification of Changes to This Policy</p>
                <p>FNAF is continually improving and adding new functionality and features to its web sites
                    and improving and adding to our existing products, services, and programs. Because of these
                    ongoing changes, changes in the law, and the changing nature of technology, FNAF’s data
                    practices will change from time to time. If and when our data practices change, FNAF will
                    post the changes on our web sites to notify you of the changes. We encourage you to check this
                    page frequently. This policy was last updated on December 9, 2015.</p>
                <p>Personal Data Collected Through FNAF.com</p>
                <p>Other than cookies, as described below, the only personal data FNAF currently collects
                    through its web sites is the information you voluntarily give us when you use our sites.</p>
                <p>For example, you may use this site to contact FNAF with questions and comments. When you
                    fill out a form on our web sites, you may provide your name and other contact information,
                    including your e-mail address, and your mailing address or the mailing address of your company
                    or other personal information. When you submit information or register for events through
                    unblocked-games.s3.amazonaws.com, you will receive a confirmation e-mail to the address we have
                    on file. When you use our web sites to search for information you are not providing us with any
                    personal information. The FNAF does not collect or retain any identifying information
                    about you when you use the search features.</p>
                <p><strong>By accepting this Privacy Policy, you give us permission to allow third parties to drop
                        cookies and/or use web beacons for advertising and tracking purposes.</strong></p>
                <p>Third parties might use information gathered by cookies and/or web beacons for the purpose of
                    online behavioral advertising and/or multisite advertising. The types of information that is
                    gathered by third party cookies and/or web beacons as well as the purpose(s) for which this
                    information is used, are set out in the privacy policy of said third parties which FNAF
                    encourages you to review. FNAF declines all and any liability for any third party cookies
                    or web beacons deployed by third parties for whatever purpose.</p>
                <p>The Site may therefore use third party cookies such as cookies from:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appnexus</li>
                    <li>Google Ad Exchange</li>
                    <li>Google Adsense</li>
                    <li>OpenX</li>
                    <li>Rubicon</li>
                    <li>Index Exchange</li>
                    <li>Pubmatic</li>
                    <li>DistrictM</li>
                    <li>Amazon</li>
                    <li>Telaria</li>
                    <li>Adinplay</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In addition, the Site also uses third party cookies such as cookies from Google Analytics.</p>
                <p>Google Analytics is a free service by Google to collect statistics of websites and to represent
                    them in detail. The website administrator thus has a clear view on visitor flows, traffic flows
                    and page displays. This way it is possible to adapt parts of a website or complete websites to
                    the behavior and interests of the visitors.</p>
                <p>Use of Personal Data Collected Through FNAF.com</p>
                <p>FNAF uses the personal information you provide to answer your question or resolve your
                    problem. FNAF uses this information to help us improve the content and functionality of
                    our web sites, to improve our products and services. FNAF may use this information to
                    contact you in the future to tell you about products or services we believe will be of interest
                    to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to
                    “opt-out” of receiving future communications. Similarly, we may provide “subscription” e-mail
                    services, which enable you to receive current news. For all such services, we will provide an
                    opportunity to “opt-out” of, or cancel, the subscription.</p>
                <p>Anonymous Data Collected Through FNAF.com</p>
                <p>In addition to the information you provide when you use our web sites, FNAF uses technology
                    to collect anonymous information about the use of our web sites. For example, we use technology
                    to track how many visitors access our web sites, the date and time of their visit, the length of
                    their stay, and which pages they view. We also use technology to determine which web browsers
                    our visitors use and the address from which they accessed our sites (for example, if they
                    connected to a FNAF web site by clicking on one of our banner ads). This technology does
                    not identify you personally. It simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and
                    their use of our sites. FNAF and our affiliates use this anonymous data to improve the
                    content and functionality of our web sites to improve our products and services.</p>
                <p>Cookies</p>
                <p>A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored on your
                    computer’s hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer and they cannot be used to discover
                    the identity of a user. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This
                    enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not and whether you are required to accept the
                    cookie to view certain content. FNAF may use cookies to “persist” a user session — that
                    is, to maintain connection with a user as he or she moves through an application or series of
                    web pages. The purpose of cookies in this context is to remember user inputs. Personalization
                    features also use cookies to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate content and
                    services and allow you to skip the login process.</p>
                <p>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</p>
                <p>FNAF may share some or all of the personal data collected through this web site with our
                    affiliates, who use this data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.FNAF may on a limited
                    basis share personal data collected through its web sites with affiliates who act for or on
                    behalf of FNAF (for example, companies that provide support services to us like insurance,
                    or that help us market our products and services). These companies may need information about
                    you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the
                    information we share with them for any other purpose. In addition, there may be some other,
                    limited circumstances in which FNAF may share or transfer the personal data in our
                    databases, for example, to comply with a legal requirement or for the administration of
                    justice.<br>While no method of data transmission is guaranteed against unlawful third party
                    interception or other misuse, FNAF uses commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
                    protection of your data including industry-standard encryption and offline security methods in
                    our physical facilities.</p>

                <p>FNAF’s web sites contain hyperlinks to other sites that are not operated by FNAF.
                    These hyperlinks are provided for your reference and convenience only and do not imply any
